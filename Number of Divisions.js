/*
DESCRIPTION:
Calculate how many times a number can be divided by a given number.

Example
For example the number 6 can be divided by 2 two times:

1. 6 / 2 = 3
2. 3 / 2 = 1 remainder = 1
100 can be divided by 2 six times:

1. 100 / 2 = 50
2. 50 / 2 = 25
3. 25 / 2 = 12 remainder 1
4. 12 / 2 = 6
5. 6 / 2 = 3
6. 3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1
*/
const divisions = (n, divisor) => n.toString(divisor).length - 1;

console.log(divisions(6, 2)); //2
console.log(divisions(100, 2)); //6
console.log(divisions(2450, 5)); //4
console.log(divisions(9999, 3)); //8
console.log(divisions(2, 3)); //0
console.log(divisions(5, 5)); //1
