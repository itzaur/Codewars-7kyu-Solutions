Description:
Task

Your task is to write a function which returns the n-th term of the following series, which is the sum of the first n terms of the sequence (n is the input parameter).
Series:1+14+17+110+113+116+…\mathrm{Series:}\quad 1 + \frac14 + \frac17 + \frac1{10} + \frac1{13} + \frac1{16} + \dotsSeries:1+41​+71​+101​+131​+161​+…

You will need to figure out the rule of the series to complete this.
Rules

    You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.

    If the given value is 0 then it should return "0.00".

    You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

Examples (Input --> Output)

n
1 --> 1 --> "1.00"
2 --> 1 + 1/4 --> "1.25"
5 --> 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 --> "1.57"
*/
function SeriesSum(n) {
  return Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => 1 / (1 + i * 3))
    .reduce((acc, el) => acc + el, 0)
    .toFixed(2);
}

console.log(SeriesSum(2)); //'1.25'
console.log(SeriesSum(3)); //'1.39'
console.log(SeriesSum(4)); //'1.49'
