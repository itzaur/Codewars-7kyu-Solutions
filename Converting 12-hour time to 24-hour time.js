Description:

Converting a 12-hour time like "8:30 am" or "8:30 pm" to 24-hour time (like "0830" or "2030") sounds easy enough, right? Well, let's see if you can do it!

You will have to define a function, which will be given an hour (always in the range of 1 to 12, inclusive), a minute (always in the range of 0 to 59, inclusive), and a period (either a.m. or p.m.) as input.

Your task is to return a four-digit string that encodes that time in 24-hour time.
Notes

    By convention, noon is 12:00 pm, and midnight is 12:00 am.
    On 12-hours clock, there is no 0 hour, and time just after midnight is denoted as, for example, 12:15 am. On 24-hour clock, this translates to 0015.

function to24hourtime(hour, minute, period) {
  const hours = (hour % 12) + (period === 'pm' ? 12 : 0);
  const minutes = minute.toString().padStart(2, '0');

  return `${hours < 10 ? '0' : ''}${hours}${minutes}`;
}
