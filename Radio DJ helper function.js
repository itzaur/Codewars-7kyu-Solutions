The Problem
James is a DJ at a local radio station. As it's getting to the top of the hour, he needs to find a song to play that will be short enough to fit in before the news block. He's got a database of songs that he'd like you to help him filter in order to do that.

What To Do
Create longestPossible(longest_possible in python and ruby) helper function that takes 1 integer argument which is a maximum length of a song in seconds.

songs is an array of objects which are formatted as follows:

{artist: 'Artist', title: 'Title String', playback: '04:30'}
You can expect playback value to be formatted exactly like above.

Output should be a title of the longest song from the database that matches the criteria of not being longer than specified time. If there's no songs matching criteria in the database, return false.
*/
function longestPossible(playback) {
  function convertToSeconds(time) {
    const [minutes, seconds] = time.split`:`;

    return +minutes * 60 + +seconds;
  }

  return (
    songs
      .filter((el) => playback >= convertToSeconds(el.playback))
      .sort(
        (a, b) => convertToSeconds(b.playback) - convertToSeconds(a.playback)
      )[0]?.title || false
  );
}

const songs = [
  { artist: 'Marillion', title: 'Keyleigh', playback: '03:36' },
  { artist: 'Pink Floyd', title: 'Time', playback: '06:48' },
  { artist: 'Rush', title: 'YYZ', playback: '04:27' },
  { artist: 'Bonobo', title: 'Days To Come', playback: '03:50' },
  { artist: 'Coldplay', title: 'Yellow', playback: '04:32' },
  {
    artist: 'Bloc Party',
    title: 'Like Eating Glass',
    playback: '04:22',
  },
  {
    artist: 'The Killers',
    title: 'For Reasons Unknown',
    playback: '03:30',
  },
  {
    artist: 'Arctic Monkeys',
    title: 'Teddy Picker',
    playback: '03:25',
  },
  {
    artist: 'Joe Satriani',
    title: 'Surfing With The Alien',
    playback: '04:34',
  },
];

console.log(longestPossible(215)); //"For Reasons Unknown"
